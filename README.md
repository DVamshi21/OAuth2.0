1. Add Spring Authorization Server Dependency
Include the spring-authorization-server dependency manually in your build tool (Maven/Gradle) if not available in Initializr.

2. Configure Security Filter Chain
3.Set up Spring Security to require authentication for protected endpoints.

Enable form-based login or other authentication methods.

4. Set Up the Authorization Server Configuration
Use @EnableAuthorizationServer (Spring Security 5.x) or define an AuthorizationServerSettings bean (Spring Authorization Server 1.x+).

Configure endpoints like /oauth2/token, /oauth2/authorize.

5. Register Clients
Define OAuth2 clients (e.g., client ID, client secret, scopes, grant types).

Store client details in memory, database, or via a service.

6. Set Up User Authentication
Configure a user details service (e.g., in-memory or JDBC).

Ensure users can log in and authenticate properly.

7. Configure Token Settings
Define token expiration, signing algorithm (e.g., JWT with RSA keys).

Set up token generation and customization if needed.

8. Test OAuth2 Flows
Use tools like Postman or curl to test:

Authorization Code Flow

Client Credentials Flow

Password Flow (if supported)

Refresh Token Flow

9. Secure and Validate
Use HTTPS in production.

Store secrets securely.

Validate scopes, claims, and user permissions.

10. (Optional) Integrate Resource Server
Set up another Spring Boot app as a Resource Server.

Validate access tokens issued by your Authorization Server.
